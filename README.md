# quarkus-buildpacks-waypoint-integration

I'm trying to run a Quarkus application on Hashicorp Waypoint.

Waypoint seems to depend on buildpacks.

Fortunately, the Quarkus community has released buildpacks.

My goal is to easily run the Quarkus application on Waypoint with Docker on my local machine.

This is a personal and experimental project, so you may quit prematurely.
